    <h1>The New Yorker Caption Contest</h1>
    <p>The New Yorker Caption Contest is a long-running tradition. Each week, a cartoon is presented and readers submit their funniest captions. It's a battle of wits, and the winner gets their caption published in the magazine.</p>

        <label><input type="radio" name="funniest" value="3" /> 3. Frankly, I'm more impressed by his balance than worried about lunch.</label>

    <p>Every week, thousands of people submit captions. Some aim for absurdity. Others for dry wit. Only a few get people to laugh out loud. But what do the winners have in common—and can we use math to measure it?</p>
    <p>To find out, we analyzed a dataset of <strong>2.3 million captions</strong>, created by researchers at <a href="https://nextml.github.io/caption-contest-data/" target="_blank">NextML</a>. Each human-written caption was rated by real readers on a scale from 1 (unfunny) to 3 (funny). We then asked two AI models to generate their own captions for the same cartoon. Could machines understand humor?</p>
    <p>This story explores the patterns, personalities, and punchlines that emerged—from both humans and machines.</p>
